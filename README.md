## Section describing something you are proud of about the project
	* What we are proud of ourself in the codewise is that we implemented different shooting mechanism. There are normal shooting, shot gun shooting and rifle shooting in our game. There are other kind of proudness too. Before start this class, we learned about everything at least once before but we did not exactly know what are they, how to use and how do those work. However, while taking this summer class, we could know how do they work, how to use them properly in our code so that we could improve our knowledge much better than before. These are the things what we are proud about the project.
